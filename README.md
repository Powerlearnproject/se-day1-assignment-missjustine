Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering


Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering refers to the application of engineering principles and practices to the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software. 
Software engineering has enabled development and maintenance of databases which can store and retrieve information in seconds
Software engineering has contributed towards research and implementation of new technologies.
Through software engineering, we can design and develop new software products

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
In the Early Days (1950s-1960s) Machine Code Programming was introduced. Initial software development was done directly in machine code, which was tedious and error-prone, but a milestone in programming. The Assembly Language was introduced and made programming slightly more readable but still required a deep understanding of hardware.

In  (1960s-1970s),the introduction of Structured Programming  eg the top-down design, control flow analysis & other programming languages such as Pascal as described below.
Top-Down Design- adopted concept of breaking down complex problems into smaller, more manageable subproblems.
Control Flow Analysis: Tools for analyzing the structure and flow of programs to identify potential issues.
Programming Languages: Languages like Pascal and C emerged, emphasizing structured programming principles.

Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (2010s-present)
Natural Language Processing: Enabling computers to understand and process human language.
Data Science: Using data to extract insights and make predictions.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1.Planning and Requirements Gathering: This phase involves defining the project's goals, scope, and requirements. Stakeholders are identified, feasibility studies are conducted, and a detailed requirements document is created.
2.Design: The design phase outlines the software's architecture, components, and interactions. It includes creating system architecture diagrams, designing user interfaces, and developing database schemas.
3.Development: In this phase, the actual coding takes place. Developers write code, create modules, and integrate components based on the design.
4.Testing: Testing ensures that the software functions correctly and meets the specified requirements.  
5.Deployment: Once the software is tested and approved, it is deployed into the production environment through installing the software, configuring servers, and providing user training.
6.Maintenance:  This is achieved through bug fixes, updates, enhancements, and technical support to ensure software functions properly as required.   


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology favours projects with well-defined requirements, stable environments, and predictable timelines while agile methodology is best suited for projects with uncertain or evolving requirements, complex domains, and the need for rapid development and delivery.
Waterfall methodology follows a linear approach, where one phase must be completed before the next begins while agile methodology breaks down projects into smaller iterations, delivering working software early and often.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer roles
Design and coding: Develops the software's features and functionality based on the design specifications.
Implementation: Writes clean, efficient, and maintainable code.
Testing: Creates and executes unit tests to ensure code quality.
Problem-solving: Identifies and resolves technical issues.
Collaboration: Works closely with other team members, including QA engineers and project managers.

Quality Assurance Engineer roles
Testing: Develops and executes test cases to identify defects in the software.
Test planning: Creates test plans and strategies.
Defect tracking: Reports and tracks defects, ensuring they are resolved.
Automation: Develops and maintains automated test scripts.
Quality standards: Ensures that the software meets quality standards and best practices.

Project Manager roles
Planning and coordination: Defines project goals, creates project plans, and assigns tasks to team members.
Resource management: Allocates resources effectively and manages project budgets.
Risk management: Identifies and mitigates potential risks.
Communication: Communicates project progress, issues, and decisions to stakeholders.
Stakeholder management: Manages expectations and relationships with clients and other stakeholders.



Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs are essential tools for software developers, providing a comprehensive set of features to streamline the development process. They often include:
Code editor: A specialized text editor with features like syntax highlighting, code completion, and refactoring EG Visual studio code

VCS are crucial for managing changes to source code over time. They provide features like Centralized repository which is a single location where all team members can access and contribute to the codebase, eg github

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Rapid Technology advancement- Software engineers need to be ontoes in the upskilling and embracing the developments to match the rapid tech developments
time constraints-   Software engineers should plan their schedules and stick by them to ensure they met deadlines and still deliver quality to their clients
Limited resources- High performing tools and big data storage solutions are quite expensive and their lack can hinder success of a project

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit- involves testing of each individual unit on its own separately from the rest of the system. Ensures that the unit is working correctly before combining with othe runits
Integration- shows how different components work together. Helps to identify problems that may arise from combining the various units
System- checks the fully integrated software to ensure it meets requirement. Confirms that system works great to fulfil user needs
Acceptance-conducted by real user to ascertain if the system can handle  user needs in real life scenarios



#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering refers to the process of crafting the best instructions to achieve a best result from your AI assistant

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
A vague prompt would be asking your AI a question like ," how do i prepare vegetable meal " when you really wanted to know how to prepare spinach or kale. Vegetables is quite broad and would not give the answer you needed hence the need to be very specific when seeking information or help from your AI assistant. Best question should be,"how do i prepare kale meal"
